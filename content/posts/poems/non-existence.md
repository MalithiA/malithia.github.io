Sometimes I wish  
Maybe for a moment  
If I could not exist  

The trees the cars the dust the mangoes  
Would all exist  
And the fish will swim  
Never having known a world  
With me in it  

All the things that  
Rise and fall  
Arrive and depart  
Collate and separate  
Take form and decease  

Would stop gnawing on the inside  

If  
For a moment  
I did not exist
