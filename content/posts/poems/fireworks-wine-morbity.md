At ten the fireworks started.  
Bursts of red and blue and yellow and white,  
Lighted up the sky.  
Little drops of fire,  
Falling from the stars.  
Staring eyes reflected the light,  
Dripping down from the endless skies.  


A .sudden. flash of light  

Brought back memories of the slums right outside resort gates  

Faces of men and women pain ridden  

In the time the  

Fireworks started and  
Ended  

Somewhere in the slums  

A woman may have been . raped  
A child may  

have been beaten  
A man  
may have hung himself to death-  

Everything felt   
sterile Everything  

felt morbid  

The world  

felt  
distorted  


Another flash of light.  
Another sip of wine.  
The red and white fireworks were my favourite.
